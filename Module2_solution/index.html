    <p>Flowers open when they feel the sunlight
		Moonrise, tide change right before our eyes
		Aggressive but softly, you place your lips on my lips
		We're each other's vice
		Our feelings, they go deep, deeper than the touching
		Deeper than the ocean, so we ain't never rushing through
		Our days, or our nights, ain't no repercussions
		Never get enough, I'm only for your consumption</p>

	<p>Let's set each other's lonely nights
	Be each other's paradise
	Need a picture for my frame
	Someone to share my ring
	Tell me what you wanna drink
	I tell you what I got in mind
	Oh I don't know your name
	But I feel like that's gonna change</p>

		<p>Dance with me under the diamonds
		See me like breath in the cold
		Sleep with me here in the silence
		Come kiss me, silver and gold
		You say that I won't lose you
		But you can't predict the future
		So, just hold on like you will never let go
		Yeah, if you ever move on without me
		I need to make sure you know that</p>
